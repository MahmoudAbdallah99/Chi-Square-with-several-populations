# Chi-Square-with-several-populations
SAS Example for Testing Differences among Proportions from Several Populations

SAS program for the example of mastitis in cows on three farms
# Output explanation
The first table presents farm by mastitis categories, the number and percentage of observations in each category (Frequency and Percent), the percentage by farm (Col Pct) and the percentage by incidence of mastitis (Row Pct). In the second table chi-square value (Chi-square), degrees of freedom (DF) and the P value (Pr > ChiSq) along with some other similar tests and coefficients, are presented. The P value is 0.0012 and thus H0 is rejected.
